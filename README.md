# IA High school Project

Enhanced by Lafie-rage. 
Based on our teacher code.

----
## Brief
The goal was to make an IA capable to move in a maze and to gather mussels which give points to the players.
There is also 2 kind of boosts which are :

- Beer : allows us to make 3 moves in a row
- Chips : allows us to jump 1 cell.

----
## Compile
Use the command in the root's project directory

```console
make
```

----
## Execute
After compiling it, you can either use the makefile by doing
```console
make exec
```

This command will execute the program with default parameters :

- serveur ip : 127.0.0.1
- serveur port : 1337
- IA name : Archspire

Or you can make this command line
```console
java Client <serveurIp> <serveurPort> <IAName>
```

----
## What is its name
Call it Archspire.
Just to make [leolassus](https://github.com/leolassus) mad :)
